# Project Overview 

## Project name: Squirrel Safari

Link coming soon

## Project Description

Squirrel Safari is an updated version of my [P1 Squirrel Safari](https://github.com/timhausweiler/p1-squirrel-safari). This app's second version will not only allow users to read through other user's stories about observations of the squirrel population in Central Park, but in addition will also allow users to submit their own stories. These stories will then be added to our collection of stories and will be made available to read for all other users.

## Wireframes

The wireframes below depict the homepage and review feed for What-cha-Think in web, tablet and phone format. The homepage contains a header displaying the app title and three clickable icons - movies, television and sports - that route to each respective review feed. The review feeds contain an input form and submit button for review data. Below the form is a feed of all past forms, along with a delete button for each post. The screens will center as screen size decreases.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of what i want my application to look like and what exactly I want it to do. As such, I can better plan for what needs to be done and how long it will take. I also know which labs and excercise I can reference if I get lost along the way.

### Weaknesses:

I am still not terribly clear on CRUD and how to make sure I can carry each aspect out for this project. Additionally, I prefer to stick to functional components but given the parameters of the project, I'll need to use class components, as well. I will likely use most of my research time/manager help on these matters.

### Opportunities:

This project is the culmination of the last 2 weeks and will give me an opportunity to solidify my understanding of react. I also happen to be interested in the function of my app given my interests, so I am motivated to make it look usable and attractive.

### Threats:

Whenever I get stuck with an error or an issue, I tend to go down a rabbit hole of online searches and debugging. Often times, I don't timebox these episodes and lose a lot of time. While this is typically a favorable characteristic in a developer, I'll need to make sure I know when to ask for help.
